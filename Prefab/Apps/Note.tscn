But anyways I have some tasks for you to do!

First I'll need you to download 15 things off \"Pirate Creek\"

It doesn't matter what it is, but 15 is the amount I need you to download to make sure everything is working as intended!

OH
and don't worry about the ads, we need to get some ads going for some money ;)

Try to get this done as soon as you can!
